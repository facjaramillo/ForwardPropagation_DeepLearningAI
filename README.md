This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exercise where you will implement Forward Propagation.

What you should expect to learn from this exercise:
- You will be able to implement the forward propagation step in a simple nn.
- You will understand how data flows in simple nns using NumPy.
- You will learn how to use ReLU and Sigmoid functions.

Make sure you have Docker installed. Then run the following commands:

- git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
- cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
- docker build -t nn-exercise .
- docker run -p 8888:8888 nn-exercise

Note: If you have any issue running the docker commands, try replacing "docker" for "sudo docker".

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8888 to access the notebook.
