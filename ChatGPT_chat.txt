Curriculum Engineer Take-Home Assessment Review

Summary of Key Feedback:

âœ… Exercise Appropriateness for Intermediate Learners:
- Topic is appropriate: forward propagation with NumPy includes relevant intermediate concepts.
- Scaffolding is present and effective.
- Suggested improvements: add learning goals, pseudocode/diagram, and optional challenges.

ðŸ§  Hardest Parts for Learners:
1. Managing matrix dimensions and broadcasting.
2. Correct placement and application of activation functions.
3. Understanding return structure and output shape.
4. Connecting the output (A2) to predictions or next steps.
â†’ Suggestions: Add shape hints, ReLU/sigmoid pseudocode, and clarification comments.

ðŸ“š Instructional Design Evaluation:
- Strengths: Scaffolded code, tests, reasonable difficulty.
- Improvements:
  - Add learning goals upfront.
  - Insert a diagram or pseudocode block before the function.
  - Add reflection questions before coding.
  - Use inline shape hints and print-based sanity checks.
  - Use a conversational tone to increase learner engagement.

ðŸ§ª Unit Test Review:
- Current tests are solid but basic.
- Improvements:
  - Add varied input cases (e.g., batch inputs).
  - Add checks for common mistakes (e.g., missing activation).
  - Improve assertion messages.
  - Add a final success message to motivate learners.

ðŸ§© Additional Thought-Provoking Questions:
- What happens if you remove activation functions?
- Why is the bias shaped (n, 1)?
- How to manually verify matrix output?
- How do weight shapes define the network?
- Why can't a single-layer network solve XOR?

Conclusion:
The exercise is well-structured and functional, but it can become more engaging, educational, and robust with some targeted refinements in pedagogy, code structure, and learner support. These improvements will better demonstrate your capabilities as a Curriculum Engineer.
